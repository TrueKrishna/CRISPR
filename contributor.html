          <h2>We are Excited!</h2>
        <p>  We understand that you may want to contribute to the server, and in all fairness, it's for a noble cause. We appreciate you for it. <br><br>

          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, there are a few things you must keep in mind before uploading files to the server. First and foremost, we are accepting courses, academic materials, and multimedia. Multimedia may consist of movies, anime, web series, and documentaries.<br><br>
          
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That being said, please understand that the server is a public asset and falls under scrutiny. Uploading porn, hentai, or other objectionable material will jeopardize the server for everyone. The administration has threatened to shut down the server if any such incidents occur.
          In case you are penetration testing the server, let us know. We can do it together! There is no need to try and inject viruses, which may cause a thousand people to lose access to the oasis of knowledge we have built.  Please use your rational mind and refrain from earning a despicable reputation.
          <br><br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; All the content uploaded will be scrutinized for malice first and then shifted to the main server by the CRISPR moderator team. You may notice that the content you have uploaded disappears after a while. This is normal. Your data has been successfully uploaded.
